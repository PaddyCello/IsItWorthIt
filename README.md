# Project Two - Is It Worth It?

# Project Brief

Working in a pair (with [Hamza Butt](https://github.com/HamzaaMB)), build a React app in two days that uses data from one or more third-party APIs.

# Overview and Concept

After initially drawing a blank while browsing through numerous free APIs, my teammate and I eventually realised that we could make something more interesting by combining two APIs: specifically, [restcountries.eu](https://restcountries.eu/) and [travelbriefing.org](https://travelbriefing.org/api). Our idea was that we could use the data from restcountries.eu to provide a list of countries to choose from, attractively displayed with all of the national flags, flex-wrapped in CSS. On selection of one of these list items, a new API request would be made to travelbriefing.org, returning information about various potential impediments to visiting the selected country - things like water safety, required vaccinations, and most crucially, whether or not the weather would be warm and sunny. Our intention throughout was to take a somewhat tongue-in-cheek approach to ensuring that the user, sick of Covid lockdowns and desperate for a holiday, chooses wisely.
